# NoxPlayerPortable
A script that will make a portable version of NoxPlayer (Windows Only)

How to run:
run one of the bat files (Setup-No-Pause-Clean-After.bat is the best to run) and after the script complete running, a folder named noxplayer will apear, you can copy that folder to whereever you want (like a usb). 
to launch noxplayer, run the bat file in the noxplayer folder (normal you would use RunNox.bat).

Sorry for my bad english


Note:
The chance that i would update this is not very big.
