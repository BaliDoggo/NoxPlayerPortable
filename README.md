# NoxPlayerPortable
A script that will make a almost portable version of NoxPlayer (Windows Only) (using 7zip and HttpDownloader)

Please download the whole repository, the version of the script in releases doesn't download the newest version of nox player!

Edit: oh wait, i removed the one from releases already. Lmao
____________________________________________________

How to run setup:

please first launch httpdownloader from the tools folder and allow it in your virus scanner (it is detected as malware but it isnt malware) then close it and run one of the scripts.
Note: after the download please mannualy close httpdownloader

run one of the bat files (Setup-No-Pause-Clean-After.bat is the best to run). 
after the script complete running the folder noxplayer is ready to beign copied, you can copy that folder to whereever you want (like a usb). 

How to launch:
to launch noxplayer, run the bat file in the noxplayer folder (normal you would use RunNox.bat). i need to find a way to redirect Program files since it cant run without Bignox and thats a problem since i cant get it to work in the same folder...


////I made a version that uses curl instead of httpdownloader

Sorry for my bad english


Note:
The chance that i would update this is not very big.


If httpdownloader has problems (keep httpdownloader open), try to manually download nox player and put the exe in the folders with the scripts, then close httpdownloader. (Seems to work by some people)
